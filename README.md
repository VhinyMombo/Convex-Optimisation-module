Module for Convex optimisation from gradient descent to proximal method

## a - Gradient Descent vs Steepest descent.

We can give an interesting alternative interpretation of the steepest descent direc-
tion $∆x$ sd as the gradient search direction after a change of coordinates is applied
to the problem. Define ū = P 1/2 u, so we have kuk P = kūk 2 . Using this change
of coordinates, we can solve the original problem of minimizing f by
